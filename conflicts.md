I am currently employed by Elsevier. All statements on this site are my own and should not be construed as statements by Elsevier.

I am co-editor of a Morgan & Claypool book series and have written a book for them. I also am co-author of a book by MIT Press. I receive (rather meager) royalties.

I regularly collaborate with Vrije Universitiet Amsterdam and hold a guest status there.

I currently serve on the Board of Directors of FORCE11.

Over my professional career, I have received travel support from a number of organizations. Travel costs are covered by meeting organizers, my employer or myself.

I've been involved in research projects funded by a wide range of funders including the European Union, EU Innovative Medicines Initiative, NSF, NWO, EPSRC, and DARPA.
