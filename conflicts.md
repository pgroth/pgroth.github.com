I am currently employed by the University of Amsterdam. All statements on this site are my own and should not be construed as statements by the university.

I am co-editor of a Morgan & Claypool book series and have written a book for them. I also am co-author of a book published by MIT Press. I receive (rather meager) royalties.

I regularly collaborate with the Vrije Universitiet Amsterdam.

I was a founding member of [FORCE11](http://force11.org) and served on the board of directors.

Over my professional career, I have received travel support from a number of organizations. Travel costs are covered by meeting organizers, my employer or myself.

I've been involved in research and consultancy projects funded by a wide range of funders including the European Union, EU Innovative Medicines Initiative, NSF, NWO, EPSRC, DARPA, AFOSR and companies Elsevier, Ahold Delhaize, Semi Technology.
